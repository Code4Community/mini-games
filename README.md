Welcome to the minigames team file homepage! In this repository, we will create several files that will create our overall Math Blasters project. Each one of our main files is listed below. 

The Math Blasters project is a super engaging and intriguing minigame that will incorporate multiple CS fundamentals in a game format. Students can play the game and have fun while learning aobut basic coding principles. Additionally, the game will encompass other minigames if time permits. As a result, all of our students will continue to learn and be engaged!

BRAINSTORMING:

Drop-in: team boolean logic 

Set variables:  
    Could set game state  
    What libraries do we use? 
    P5 
    Phasor 

Math Blaster: 
    Could spin-up minigames if you get something right 
    Special effects with if-statements 
    If-statements can be taught with fill-in the blank values in conditionals 
    Learn to use loops to shoot multiple balls at once 

Another Mini-game: 
    If-statements combat-game (ninja)
