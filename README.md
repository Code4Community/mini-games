Welcome to the minigames team file homepage! In this repository, we will create several files that will create our overall Math Blasters project. Each one of our main files is listed below. 

The Math Blasters project is a super engaging and intriguing minigame that will incorporate multiple CS fundamentals in a game format. Students can play the game and have fun while learning aobut basic coding principles. Additionally, the game will encompass other minigames if time permits. As a result, all of our students will continue to learn and be engaged!
